Howdy! My name is Matt Johnson. I'm a Texan who found his way to Germany back in 2021 and a System Engineer at SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH. I specialize in everything Microsoft, with a particular focus on Azure. Most of my day-to-day work relates to automation and scripting, and my current project revolves around automating the management of Microsoft Sentinel content at-scale for a managed SOC.

I work about 8 hours per day and sleep for around 7. I spend the remaining 9 hours of my day doing some combination of playing chess, playing guitar, going outside, and hanging out with my fiancÃ©e and/or dog.

Feel free to contact me at [me@mattjohnson.cloud](mailto:me@mattjohnson.cloud) or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsonmatte/) for inquiries, opinions, hate mail, or whatever else. Likewise, feel free to add or challenge me on one of the chess platforms. My handle on Lichess is [mejohnson](https://lichess.org/@/mejohnson) and on chess.c*m it's [kebab](https://www.chess.com/member/kebab).

For the few who have managed to stumble onto the about page of a largely irrelevant website, I will reward you with a picture of my dog Daisy from when she was a tiny puppy.ðŸ˜Š
